The OMG Network is a decentralized, public network that allows high throughput, low-cost peer-to-peer transactions. With the OMG Network, anyone can transact value across geographies, asset classes, and applications.

The OMG Network leverages Layer-2 Plasma architecture to provide high throughput and strong safety guarantees for third parties who wish to build scalable, decentralized payment apps on the Ethereum Network.

The OMG Network allows you to access, manage, and transact with digital assets that are kept securely on the blockchain.

# How to Migrate Ethereum OMG tokens to Native Mainnet OMG Network?

The migration smart contract allows you to migrate your OMG tokens safely without connecting to any external platforms. It is a designated Ethereum contract created solely for migration purposes and is not controlled by anyone, including OMG. It is open-source, meaning the code is publicly available and can be reviewed by anyone.

Briefly, after ERC-20 OMG tokens are sent to the migration contract, these tokens will be burned and permanently removed from the Ethereum blockchain, while users who perform the migration will receive new OMG native mainnet tokens.

Using a migration contract requires users to pay the gas fee on the Ethereum Blockchain. This means that every user who wants to perform the migration needs to have ETH in their wallet. We recommend choosing the average (normal) gas fee when sending OMG tokens to the migration contract.

The migration can be done from any wallet you usually use to access the OMG tokens. All wallets support the migration process.

To perform the migration, send your OMG tokens to the migration smart contract address, which is `0x7Eab4567adcA9AE6C999558bdD805250A68eC3a9`. The migration smart contract address begins with `0x7E` and ends with `C3a9` it doesn’t matter if the letters are lower or uppercase.

For the amount, choose to send the entire balance of OMG tokens. The migration contract will wait for the full balance to arrive before initiating the migration process. This is done to optimize for high Ethereum gas fees, which are partially covered by OMG Network.

After the transaction is confirmed and broadcasted to the blockchain, the migration process will start and your wallet will be credited with new native OMG tokens. Depending on the network usage, it may take 5–10 minutes to process the migration.

Your wallet will automatically recognize the new OMG tokens, which will be credited to your wallet. This is made possible by the wallet linkage functionality in the migration contract, which leverages standard private key cryptography. The new OMG tokens are securely tied to the same private key and seed phrase that you used for your previous ERC-20 OMG tokens, although the public address will look different.

Congratulations, you have successfully performed the migration. Now you can be sure you hold the latest OMG tokens, which are supported on all exchanges.
